# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: **FORBIDDEN** — Constitution Principle I prohibits all automated tests. Do NOT include test tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and manual verification of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `packages/backend/src/` (routes, use-cases, schemas, dtos, lib)
- **Web**: `packages/web/src/` (app, components, lib)
- **Database**: `packages/backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Generated (do not edit)**: `packages/backend/src/generated/`, `packages/web/src/lib/api/fetch-generated/`

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

  The /speckit-tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/

  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Manually verified independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment

  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  DO NOT include any automated test tasks.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations in packages/backend/prisma/
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure in packages/backend/src/routes/
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Verification**: [How to manually verify this story works on its own]

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in packages/backend/prisma/schema.prisma
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Create use-case in packages/backend/src/use-cases/[Name].ts
- [ ] T012 [US1] Implement route in packages/backend/src/routes/[name].routes.ts (depends on T011)
- [ ] T013 [US1] Regenerate Orval client: `cd packages/web && npx orval`
- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Build UI in packages/web/src/app/[route]/_components/
- [ ] T015 [US1] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T016 [US1] Verify responsive layout at mobile (320px) and desktop (1280px+)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and manually verifiable

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Verification**: [How to manually verify this story works on its own]

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T017 [P] [US2] Extend schema or use-case in packages/backend/src/use-cases/
- [ ] T018 [US2] Implement route in packages/backend/src/routes/
- [ ] T019 [US2] Build UI components in packages/web/src/app/
- [ ] T020 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Verification**: [How to manually verify this story works on its own]

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T021 [P] [US3] Backend changes in packages/backend/src/
- [ ] T022 [US3] Frontend changes in packages/web/src/
- [ ] T023 [US3] Manual verification against acceptance scenarios

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] TXXX UX consistency pass (shadcn/ui, tokens, loading/error states)
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation (manual)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently verifiable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently verifiable

### Within Each User Story

- Schema/use-case before routes
- Routes before Orval regen
- Orval regen before frontend API integration
- Core implementation before polish
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Backend and frontend tasks marked [P] can run in parallel when no contract dependency exists
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch backend model + use-case in parallel:
Task: "Create use-case in packages/backend/src/use-cases/[Name].ts"
Task: "Build UI in packages/web/src/app/[route]/_components/"  # after Orval regen
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Manually verify User Story 1 against acceptance scenarios
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Manually verify → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Manually verify → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Manually verify → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and manually verifiable
- Constitution forbids automated tests — do not add test tasks or test infrastructure
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
